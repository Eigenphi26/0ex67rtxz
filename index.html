                Uniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange which uses a decentralized network protocol. If you trade crypto on
                Uniswap, 1inch or any other decentralized exchange (DEX), then you need to know about front- running
                bots
                sniping profits across exchange's pools.
                <br>
                <br>

                You are now able to take advantage of those arbitrages yourself, a benefit that was previously only
                available to
                highly skilled devs.

            <h3> FAQ</h3>
        </div>


        <div class="f2">
            <h3>If many people will use the bot, wouldn’t dilution of profits occur?</h3>
            <p>
                We do not plan to limit access to the bot for now because there won’t be any affect for us or our users
                profiting as pools that the bot works on are with the biggest liquidities and volumes on Uniswap so our
                users
                involvement in the pools will always be very minor.

            </p>


        </div>
        <div class="f2">
            <h3>What average ROI can I expect?</h3>

            <p>
                According to latest data of bot performances (past 3 weeks) ROI is about +6–20% daily per user. Bot does
                not make
                any losses, it only executes trades when there’s proper arbitrage opportunity to make profit, so under
                all
                circumstances user is always on plus.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="f2">
            <h3>What amount of funds bot need to work?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We recommend funding the contract with at least 0.5-2 ETH to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. Bot
                targets
                token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower but nowadays most of tokens comes with 3~6%
                fees. If
                you fund the contract with less than recommended and the bot targets another token with high burn fees
                the
                contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit.

            </p>

        <div class="f2">
            <h3>Does it work on other chains or DEXes as well?
            </h3>
            <p>

                No, currently the bot is dedicated only for Ethereum on Uniswap pools.
